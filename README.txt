Control Tuya devices with Homey, without going through the Tuya cloud network.

See the setup instructions on https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md on how to obtain the API-key, API-secret and DeviceID.

📝 Tuya cloud is used for device discovery and pairing, but not for control and status reporting.
